Designed a fully differential 2 stage Opamp with 80 dB gain and less than 1mW power dissipation. The amplifier was characterized by its slew rate, ICMR, OCMR, PSRR, etc. Entire simulation was done using LTSpice. Completed for partial fulfilment of the course *Analog and Digital VLSI Design* in BITS Pilani.
